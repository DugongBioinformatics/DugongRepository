<h1> GSEA Common Errors </h1>


<h2><u>
None of the gene sets passed the size thresholds
</u>
</h2>
<!--<a name="1001"/> -->

None of the gene sets that you specified passed the size threshold. Check that the selected gene sets:

   <ol>
   <li> Contain more than the minimum number of genes. The minimum gene set size is set by the Min size parameter (by default, 15).
   </li>
   <li> Contain fewer than the maximum number of genes. The maximum gene set size is set by the Max size parameter (by default, 500).
   </li>
   <li>Use the gene identifiers appropriate for this analysis:
      If you are collapsing your dataset (Collapse dataset to gene symbols parameter = True), the genes in the collapsed dataset are identified by 	gene symbol, so the gene identifiers in your gene sets must be gene 	symbols.
      If you are not collapsing your dataset (Collapse dataset to gene symbols 	parameter = False), the gene identifiers in your gene sets must be the same 	as those in your expression dataset.
   </li>
   </ol>
For more information about "appropriate" gene identifiers, see Consistent Feature Identifiers Across Data Files in the GSEA User Guide.

Illumina data: The probe identifiers for Illumina chips contain leading zeros. Certain programs, such as Excel, automatically remove leading zeros. If you are collapsing your dataset, the probe identifiers in your dataset must match the probe identifiers in the chip annotation file. If this error occurs and you are using Illumina data, check that the probe identifiers in your dataset include the leading zeros.

<h2>
<u>
Chip parameter must be specified as you asked to analyze in the space of gene symbols
</u>
</h2>

When you set the Collapse dataset to gene symbols parameter to True, you must select one or more chip annotation files using the Chip platform(s) parameter.

Setting the Collapse dataset to gene symbols parameter to True tells GSEA to collapse each probe set in the dataset to a single vector for the gene, which gets identified by its HUGO gene symbol. To do this, GSEA needs to map the probes in the dataset to their matching HUGO gene symbols. The chip annotation file(s) supply that mapping information. For more information, see  DNA Chip (Array) Annotations in the GSEA User Guide.

Alternatively, you can set the Collapse dataset to gene symbols parameter to False. In this case, GSEA does not collapse your dataset and the Chip platform(s) parameter is optional. If you specify it, the analysis results report includes links to the HUGO gene symbols; otherwise, the links are omitted.

<h2>
<u>
The collapsed dataset was empty when used with chip ...
</u>
</h2>

GSEA attempted to collapse each probe set in the dataset to a gene, but there was no data in the resulting dataset. The most likely reasons for this are

    <ul>	
    <li> You are attempting to collapse a dataset that is already collapsed.</li>
    <li> The probe identifiers in your dataset do not match the probe identifiers in the chip files selected in the chip platform(s) parameter.
    </li>
    </ul> 	

Check the gene/probe identifiers in your dataset. If they are HUGO gene symbols, set the Collapse dataset to gene symbols parameter to False; the dataset is already collapsed. Otherwise, check that the probe identifiers in your dataset match the probe identifiers listed  in the chip file that you selected in the chip platform(s) parameter. For more information, see Consistent Feature Identifiers Across Data Files in the GSEA User Guide.

<h2>
<u>Too few samples in the dataset to use this metric </u>
</h2>

The metric that you selected in the Metric for ranking genes parameter (Signal2Noise or tTest) requires that you have at least three samples for each phenotype. You have too few samples for at least one of the phenotypes selected in the Phenotype labels parameter.

To analyze a categorical phenotype that has fewer than three samples, use one of the following ranking metrics:

    <ul>	
    <li> Ratio_of_classes </li>
    <li> log2_Ratio_of_classes </li>
    <li> Diff_of_classes </li>
    </ul> 


For information about the metrics, see the Metric for ranking genes parameter on the Run GSEA Page in the GSEA User Guide.
For information about phenotypes, see Phenotype Labels in the GSEA User Guide.

<h2><u> As the phenotype choosen was categorical, only categorical metrics are allowed </u> 
</h2>

You selected a categorical phenotype for the Phenotype labels parameter; however, the metric that you selected in the Metric for ranking genes parameter is used with continuous phenotypes. Select one of the following metrics for a  categorical phenotype:

    <ul>
    <li> Signal2Noise (default) </li>
    <li> tTest </li>
    <li> Ratio_of_Classes </li>
    <li> Diff_of_Classes </li>
    <li> log2_Ratio_of_Classes </li>
    </ul> 

For information about phenotypes, see Phenotype Labels in the GSEA User Guide.
For information about the metrics, see the Metric for ranking genes parameter on the Run GSEA Page in the GSEA User Guide.

<h2>
<u>As the phenotype choosen was continuous, only continuous class metrics are allowed </u>
</h2>

You selected a continuous phenotype for the Phenotype labels parameter; however, the metric that you selected in the Metric for ranking genes parameter is used with categorical phenotypes. Select one of the following metrics for a  continuous phenotype:

    <ul>
    <li> Cosine </li>
    <li> Euclidean </li>
    <li> Manhattan </li>
    <li> Pearson   </li>
    </ul>
