		description="The VIPER (Virtual Inference of Protein-activity by Enriched Regulon analysis) component in geWorkbench
transforms the expression profile for each sample (column) into a transcription-factor activity profile,
representing the relative activity of each TF in each sample. The activity of each transcription factor
is inferred from that of its targets, where the targets are obtained from a cell-context-specific interaction network (interactome).
Three cell-context-specific interactomes are supplied, for leukemia, breast cancer, and prostate cancer."
